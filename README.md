# Algorithmic-Trading-Strategy-for-Ultra-Bond-UB-
</div>

## Overview
This project aims to develop a high performance trading algorithm designed for the Ultra Bond (UB) futures market. The strategyis based on Smart Money Concepts (SMC), volume spikes, time-based execution windows, economic news filtering basics elements that I have already used for passing rigorous propfirm challenge. 
The core innovation lies in the integration of multiple AI agents, each responsible of replicating key elements of discretionary trading. The goal is to pprogressively evolve the systemfrom a semi-automated assistant to a fully autonomous algorithm.
This repository documents the design, architecture, agent roles and the logic of the system. The algorithm is under **under active development** and will be refined in progressive stages.

## üîπ Core AI Agents and Their Interactions

- **SMC Agent:** Identifies key supply and demand zones, liquidity pools, and smart money footprints.  

- **Volume Spike Agent:** Detects abnormal volume peaks signaling potential reversals or breakouts.  

- **News Monitoring Agent:** Filters out trading during high-impact economic events to reduce slippage risk.  

- **Order Flow Agent:** Analyzes real-time order book dynamics to enhance entry and exit precision.  

- **Execution Agent:** Responsible for timely, efficient order placement and management to minimize slippage and execution risk.  



### üîπ Additional Intelligent Agents

- **Position Sizing Agent:** Applies game-theory-based probability calculations to optimize position sizes.  

- **Noise Filtering Agent:** Utilizes statistical filtering, signal processing, multi-timeframe analysis, and machine learning to reduce market noise.  

- **Market Regime Detector Agent:** Classifies market conditions to ensure robustness and adaptability of the strategy.  



### üîÑ  Agent Interaction Overview

The agents continuously share data and insights. For example, the Order Flow Agent refines signals from the SMC and Volume Agents, while the Market Regime Detector adjusts parameters used by all agents depending on current market conditions. The Execution Agent acts on combined signals ensuring smooth order management, and the Noise Filtering Agent helps reduce false signals before decisions are made.



## üõ† Development Stages

1. **Semi-Automatic Version:** Initial implementation with manual trade execution and basic agent support.  

2. **Partial Automation:** Algorithm suggests trades with human oversight for entry and exit.  

3. **Full Automation with Feedback Loop:** Fully automated execution with continuous performance feedback and self-adjustment.  

4. **Cloud/Cluster Optimization:** Scalability improvements via cloud computing or distributed clusters.  

5. **Future Multi-Asset Extension:** Adapting the core algorithm to correlated markets for portfolio diversification.  



## üß© Pattern Recognition Agents

Specialized AI modules trained to detect short-term recurring price and volume patterns, order flow signatures, and liquidity shifts to anticipate probable market moves in real-time.



## üõ°Ô∏è Overfitting and Performance Agent

A dedicated agent monitors the algorithm‚Äôs performance metrics, detects signs of overfitting during training and live deployment, and implements cross-validation and regularization techniques to maintain model robustness.



## ‚è±Ô∏è Advantage of Defined Trading Time Window

Trading is restricted to a two-hour time window (14:30‚Äì16:30 Spain time), strategically chosen to capture one hour before and one hour after the US market open. This period provides high liquidity, volatility, and reliable price action patterns, enhancing execution efficiency and reducing risk.
